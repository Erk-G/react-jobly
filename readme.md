Jobly is a test website that lets user's apply to jobs for different companies. Like a more simplistic Indeed.

things I would change given a longer period to work on this:

1. State token and localstorage token seem redundant, so I would remove state token.

2. profile,js Login.js and signUp.js I would refactor because they all have similar setups of being a form to submit user info.

3. Mess with the CSS to make things look better. Website looks pretty ugly. It is all white, there is no clear distinction on where companies/jobs start or end on their respective list. Navbar items are all smooshed together and have the default hyperlink look. Every button is a default button. etc.
